# bedload_simulation

Study to evaluate the influence of shape on tubulent bedload transport.

## TODO

- [ ] Relaunch computation for shape-l with changing rugosity (and more time)
- [x] Relaunch computation for shape-s with greater amount of particles and on more time
- [ ] Launch computation to check the influence of the mesh
- [ ] Launch computation to check the influence of the size of the box
- [ ] Launch computation to check the influence of the height (nb of particle layer)
